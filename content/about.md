Hi! I am Jaisurya Nanduri. I work at AWS Science as part of the Automated Reasoning Group and I like crafting software. I have experience building Modern Compilers, Chatbots using NLP , Automating Factory processes with Computer Vision and working on Full Stack Development for large scale websites. In my free time, I like reading, learning about random nerdy things and cooking.
