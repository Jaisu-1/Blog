Hi! I am Jaisurya Nanduri. I study Computer Science as a Master's Student and like crafting software, typically in the Full Stack and Deep Learning side of things. I have experience building Chatbots using NLP , Automating Factory processes with Computer Vision and working on Full Stack Development for huge websites. In my free time, I like reading, playing video games and exercising my right to do nothing at all.
