### Why Blog?

Starting a blog is a very uncharacteristic step for someone like me who's very judgemental about any attempts at self-marketing. Then why do it? Precisely for that reason. Simply put, I want to record my lessons and projects by documenting them publicly, open to criticism and review by everyone.
I think this is the best way to learn and challenge my own brain to become better at being public with my work.

#### 1. Improve Writing

I think writing and communication is a skill that sets the best apart from the regular engineers. All the engineers and even people I look upto, have phenomenal clarity of thought and speech. Their writings have focus and direction that I would one day like to have. Hopefully, I can improve and get to a point where I'm proud and happy with how I write. Until then, I'd like to improve.

#### 2. Learn by Teaching

I firmly believe the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone. Based on my observations so far, I think it's true. Being able to break down complex subjects and explain them in simple ways is a quality all great writers and engineers have possessed. I want to get there too. I want my writing to be simple and effective and to be able to teach any layman, the technical concepts that I'm explaining. This way, I'll be able to learn a lot of complex material and also grasp it well.

#### 3. Get over Shyness

I want to get over my shyness. I think marketing is very important, being able to sell your craft is probably as important as honing your craft itself. I've held back on posting anything publicly due to a fear of derision and have perhaps allowed that to take over what I needed to do, far too many times. I think by blogging publicly, I am making an effort to overcome the inertia and to finally just getting over it. 

##### Given all these reasons, I shall blog. Thanks for reading!
