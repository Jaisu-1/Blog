## Blogging Again

I want to be documenting a lot more. I've been learning and working on Rust, which is basically taking me to school for a 4th time and I've learned so much. I want to be documenting my journey through Rust, Compiler Design and Automated Reasoning, just so that I can learn faster and also hopefully teach entry-level developers that Rust is scary but worth it.

So yeah, I'm wiping off the dust on this blog and going to use this more as a programming journal and less like a portfolio. I think it's more fun that way too.

Watch this space for more updates again.
